# About

Fastreader is a user interface for reading. The goal is for speed readers to give their eyes some relaxation as you only need to look in one spot. The words will appear in the same spot at the speed you desire. A user with experience in speed reading will find they can hit a very high words-per-minute threshold (wpm) by relaxing and keeping the eyes casually fixed in the center of the word display.

Words are weighted by "complexity" in order to make simple words expedient and complicated words display slightly longer so that the user can mentally distinguish them. This is currently weighted by character types and amounts instead of recognition of words uniquely. Any feedback on enhancing this is welcome.
